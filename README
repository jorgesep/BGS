Software for evaluating BGS algorithms.
======================================

The software on this repository is the outcome of a project developed to generate automatically a set of segmented silhouettes from a common human actions dataset. For this purpose several experiments with algorithms which makes foreground and background separation were applied over [MuHAVI](http://dipersec.king.ac.uk/MuHAVi-MAS/) dataset; a dedicated collection of common human actions (run, walk, jump, etc) played on a scene with a night rough environment. On the first part of the proejct, the specific background subtraction methods run on [MuHAVi](http://dipersec.king.ac.uk/MuHAVi-MAS/) (Multicamera Human Action Video). While the second part compared the generated foreground masks with a set of manually annotate images (ground-truth) available on this dataset (MuHAVi-MAS, manually annotated set). The F1-score was the metric to make performance evaluation of the algorithms. Finally the whole MuHAVI dataset was processed choosing the best score algorithm, resulting in a set of no perfect segmented silhouettes (MuHAVi "uncut") available to experiment with human action recognition algorithms.

This Repository contains implementation of some background subtraction methods, based on statistical modelling behaviour of every pixel in a frame within image sequence. The background behaviour of a sequence is essentially modelled either with a mixture of Gaussian distributions [1][2] or Gaussian Kernels. The code is based on a set of C++ classes along with the [OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org) library. Additionally a binary program is available to evaluate the results of background subtraction algorithms included in this repository; the foreground masks generated by them can be compared against a ground truth (reference frame). The program makes a pixel-to-pixel comparison, between the silhouettes and its ground truth, resulting in a group of True/False Positive/Negative metrics which are combined to produce a general F1 score measure.



Installation
------------

All BGS modules can be build outside of the source directory with CMake tool. 
Check that all OpenCV libraries must be installed previous to build BGS modules.

Ubuntu Installation
------------------
1.- Install OpenCV

2.- Install the following packages
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install cmake git libboost-all-dev

3.- Get BGS modules from github
$ git clone https://github.com/jorgesep/BGS.git

4.- Make a build directory from outside of BGS
$ cd BGS
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

5.- run cmake command.
$ cmake ..

6.- Build modules
$ make

MAC OS X Installation
---------------------
$ export CC=gcc; export CXX=g++; cmake ../BGS
