Software for evaluating BGS algorithms.
======================================

This software provides C++ classes of some BGS (Background Subtraction) algorithms. The classes are implemented using OpenCV libraries. Additionally, a perfomance evaluation program has been included which contains quality metrics to evaluate segmentation.

The code was developed to evaluate quality segmentation of the BGS algorithms incorporated in the main module after be applied over the MuHAVi (human action dataset). The algorithms generated automatically a set of silhouettes from MuHAVi sequences and later were evaluated with performance evaluation module.

MuHAVi (Multicamera Human Action Video) is dataset of common human activities, http://dipersec.king.ac.uk/MuHAVi-MAS/

Installation
------------

All BGS modules can be build outside of the source directory with CMake tool. 
Check that all OpenCV libraries must be installed previous to build BGS modules.

Ubuntu Installation
------------------
1.- Install OpenCV

2.- Install the following packages
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install cmake git libboost-all-dev

3.- Get BGS modules from github
$ git clone https://github.com/jorgesep/BGS.git

4.- Make a build directory from outside of BGS
$ cd BGS
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

5.- run cmake command.
$ cmake ..

6.- Build modules
$ make

MAC OS X Installation
---------------------
$ export CC=gcc; export CXX=g++; cmake ../BGS
