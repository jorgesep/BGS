Software for evaluating BGS algorithms with MuHAVi a human action dataset
=====================================================================
This software was prepared for automatically generate silhouettes from MuHAVi sequences and measures segmentation quality of the generated silhouettes.
This contains a binary program with a bunch of BGS (background subtraction algorithms) based in GMM and a performance evaluation program which includes a group of quality metrics used to evaluate segmentation. 
MuHAVi (Multicamera Human Action Video) is dataset of common human activities, http://dipersec.king.ac.uk/MuHAVi-MAS/

Installation
------------

All BGS modules can be built out of source directory with CMake tool. 
Check that all OpenCV libraries must be installed previous to build BGS modules.

Ubuntu Installation
------------------
1.- Install OpenCV

2.- Install the following packages
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install cmake git libboost-all-dev

3.- Get BGS modules from github
$ git clone https://github.com/jorgesep/BGS.git

4.- Make a build directory from outside of BGS
$ cd BGS
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

5.- run cmake command.
$ cmake ..

6.- Build modules
$ make

MAC OS X Installation
---------------------
$ export CC=gcc; export CXX=g++; cmake ../BGS
